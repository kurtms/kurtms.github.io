            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I'm a software developer and third year computer science student minoring in mathematics at UC Davis. I love learning and creating things - putting my heart into even the smallest of details. I also love swimming and swim almost everyday, as well as coach for the Swim Club at UC Davis.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Solarri</h3>
                <p>I'm currently working with the Solarri Solar Car Data Team as we assemble the car's technical interface using an Android tablet and an Arduino. This was my first larger project working with a team as well as my first experience programming for Android. The Android interface is to poll data from the car's sensors and display the current data to the driver, all while recording it to a a database.</p>

            <h3>Game Programming</h3>
            <p>Following my first year of college, I wanted to make a larger project to reinforce the concepts we had learned. Using the low-level graphics and event library SDL, I created clones of both popular games <i>2048</i> and <i>Pokemon</i>. This was my first experience with event loops and management as well as graphical output beyond the command line.</p>

            <h3>Hackathons</h3>
            <p>I participated in both the UC Davis Algorithms Hackathon, which focused on interview-like algorithm queestions, and <i>HackDavis 2014</i>, which focused on applications for social good.</p>
